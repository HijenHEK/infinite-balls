# infinite-balls
The most irritating game you will ever play ! 
this is the first thing i ever coded back in 2016 :D

## story behind this 
So since i started coding regurally i always tried to find this project which was the first thing i ever built ! 
i found it in an old drive ... i almost cried xD 

its a game built with python and pygame , where you need to avoid getting hit by an infinite amount of balls ( red ones ) falling at you ,

there are two versions the first one is in the v0 folder , the second one its more enhanced where the red balls follow your moves and try to trap you , the speed increases as you score more points , the more you stay alive the more points you get !
